# Simple crud api service for music library

## How to run and test

* Just run in terminal `make up', it will start docker containers (obviosly docker, and docker compose required)
* You may also want to start mock service required by lib, `make fake_api; make run_fake` 

## Notes

* Project architecture is far from ideal, but i made in quite a rush, so could easily expalain, how to make code much better
* Swagger and logging stuff only completed on 10%, proof of concept, sort of speak)
